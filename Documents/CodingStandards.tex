\section{Introduction}
The purpose of this document is two-fold. One one hand it lays out what standards the code will adhere to. This includes the usual policies on spacing, indentation, pointer usage, ect. On the other hand, it will serve as a collection of research onto best practices. To that end, expect copious amounts of stack overflow links

\section{Pointers}

To do pointer arithmetic, the compiler needs to know the type associated with said pointers. This allows the compiler to know how to interpret any number associated with the arithmetic. In addition, the type void does not have a standardized size. If you want to pointer arithmetic with bytes, then you need the pointer to be of a type with size 1. As it happens char is standardized at size 1.
