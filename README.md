This is my implementation of Warren's Abstract Machine (WAM.) This is a work in progress, expect it to be done in around two months time. My most important resource has been <a href="http://wambook.sourceforge.net">"Warren's Abstract Machine: A Tutorial Reconstruction"</a> by Hassan AÃ¯t-Kaci. As the code base (read: documentation) grows, I will make it more explicit what segments drew heavily from his work.  

### How To:
You will need bison and flex installed. At the moment I have only built this on OSX, and it will require a newer version of bison that OSX includes. I suggest using <a href="http://brew.sh">Homebrew</a> for package management on OSX. If you do, then you will need to install these dependencies.
```
brew install bison flex
```
 The make file is setup to use the bison-3.0.4 keg, but if you have problems check the BISON variable in the makefile against the install location of bison on your computer. Then you can clone the repository and run make. 
```
git clone https://github.com/ThermalSpan/russWAM.git
cd russWAM
make
```
